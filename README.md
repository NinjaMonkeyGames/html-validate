## What is this repository for? ##

The purpose of this repository is to maintain control over versions of html-validate. This maintains uniformity-
when enforcing coding standards and formatting rules. This allows for easier upgrades and prevents newer versions from
breaking the pipeline.

---

## Configuration information ##

There is a '.htmlvalidate.json' file containing the html-validate configuration in the root of the project directory. You can
use the following YAML line to copy this into your project directory.

```shell
cp /app/.htmlvalidate $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
```

Alternately you can use the following command to use your own configuration file.

```shell
html-validate -c=.htmlvalidate.json .
```

See links below for more information about HTML-Validate and Alpine Linux.
